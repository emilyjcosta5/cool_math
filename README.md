Reflections and Notes on the papers
-----------------------------------

## Pascal
I came across this paper when messing around with a low-lag signal filter. Instead of differentiating the equation by brute force, I found a pattern that resembles Pascal's triangle and can now find the coefficients inductively. I will post the math soon.

## Quantum Mechanics and Paradigm Shifts
"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas Kuhn is a pivotal piece in scientific philosphy. This paper is in no way a replacement for the book, but it does an excellent job of giving the overview of what a Kuhnian Revolution is. It also gives a brief history of quantum mechanics. Then, the author discusses whether or not quantum mechanics brought on a shift in scientific paradigms (according to Kuhn's criteria) from classical physics.

## Lecture 21: Stochastic Differential Equations
In prepartion for a graduate course in Stochastic Differential Equations that I start next week (05/11/2020), I read over this introduction to SDEs. This text defines SDEs and their functions, provides the existence and uniqueness theorem, and finally provides some examples of simple SDEs.
Note: I realized I have not even learned PDEs. I spent some time learning the basics of PDEs to follow along.
